# LAS-Randomizer
A randomizer for The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening remake.

You can download the randomizer here: https://github.com/Owen-Splat/LAS-Randomizer/releases/latest

## Information
This randomizes all the items in the game so that every playthrough is unique. It also aims to add quality of life changes, such as skipping cutscenes, or adding options that make the game more open-world.

**Logic**:
- Basic: No glitches or advanced tricks, although 2 tile jumps are included. Recommended for beginners.
- Advanced: Skews and bomb arrows will be added to logic.
- Glitched: Adds some glitches to logic that will not result in being softlocked.
- Hell: Adds more glitches to logic that can result in softlocks.
- None: Throws all logic out the window. Seeds will likely be unbeatable.

Please note that while most things are functional, there is a possibility of the logic resulting in softlocks. This will be especially true with the glitched logics. If this does happen, dying and selecting the Save + Quit option will respawn you back at Marin's house.

## How to play:
In order to play the randomizer, you must have the RomFS of the game extracted and on the device you're running this program from. This can be extracted through your choice of emulator, or with nxdumptool on a homebrewed Switch console. After you have extracted the RomFS, keep it somewhere where you will not lose it!

Set the RomFS Path to the folder where you extracted the RomFS.

Set the Output Path to the folder where you want the edited files to go. On Emulator, you can right-click the game and open mods directory to get the path.

The Seed can be anything you want it to be, or just left blank.

### Switch
Set the output platform to `Console`. Copy and paste the `Atmosphere` folder from the output to the root of your SD card. I'd recommend to use a file transfer homebrew app to avoid needing to take the SD card out and relaunch CFW each time. The number of files will differ depending on settings, so clear out any old files first.

### Emulator
Set the output platform to `Emulator` and set the output path to the emulator's mod directory (see above) for Link's Awakening. After creating a seed, simply just enable it in the emulator and enjoy playing! You **MUST** play on version 1.0.0 otherwise the exefs patches will not work on emulator.

## Running from source:
**NOTE**: This is for advanced users or those helping with the development of this randomizer.

If you want to run from source, then you need to clone this repository and make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed

Open the folder in a command prompt and install dependencies by running:  
`py -3.8 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` (on Windows)  
`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` (on Mac)  
`python3 -m pip install $(cat requirements.txt) --user` (on Linux)

Then run the randomizer with:  
`py -3.8 randomizer.py` (on Windows)  
`python3 randomizer.py` (on Mac)  
`python3 randomizer.py` (on Linux)  

If you are using a higher version of Python, change the commands to include your version instead

Once you have installed all the requirements, there is an included **build.bat** file. Run that (you can just enter `build` in the terminal) and it will automatically enter the commands to create a build. Once again, if you are using a different version of Python, you will need to edit this file to match your version
